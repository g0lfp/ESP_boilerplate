# ESP_boilerplate
An initial bare OTA template.

Abstract:
To create a 'boilerplate application' to install on new out-of-the-box ESPduinos. The idea being that the program once installed, can be replaced with an OTA update, without having to be 'tethered' to the desktop.
The application should contain a wifi-manager to allow the user to connect to their local wifi prior to doing an OTA.
The application should contain a BIN-server for the OTA process.

Initial commit. Working version.
