Initial setup


Download and install the Arduino IDE (at the time of writing v1.8.3)
When the IDE has finished installing, you will need to add support for the ESP family. This isn't (yet) built into the boards manager, so you will have to manually add them.

Run the IDE and go to File > Preferences.

The additional boards manager URLs are at the bottom of the page.

Cut and paste the following address into that text box.

 http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json

and click OK

Now to install support for the ESP in the IDE you will have to manually install them. Go to Tools > Board > Boards manager. Scroll down to the ESP family and click in the box. You will be offered the latest version. Click on Install. This may take a few minutes, but when it's done your IDE will be ESP 'ready'.

In order to compile the sketch, a library will need to be added to the IDE.

The wifi-manager by tzapu which is available on his github repository;

https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager

Help on installing libraries is available on the Arduino website;

https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries




Uploading to the ESPduino.

Assuming that you can now successfully compile the sketch, you will still need to connect the ESPduino to the computer to install the boilerplate. After this, every time you want to update the firmware, you can do it 'Over The Air'.

Connect the ESPduino to the computer via USB. Go to Tools > Port to select the correct port. Check that the Tools > Board is set to ESPduino too.

Don't forget to set the ESPduino into flashing mode before trying to upload.

Hint: Keep the Com port monitor open, when the program runs for the first time, the ESPduino will identify itself. It is quite useful to write this on a label and attach it to the PCB if you're doing a batch of them. It makes them easier to identify afterwards.

Good luck, and above all, have fun.
